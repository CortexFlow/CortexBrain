# Contributing Best Pratictes

- 🧑🏻‍🏫 Write a clear and concise commit/Pull Request message

- ⚠️ always tag the related issue in a commit message (e.g. [#_issue number_: "_commit message_"])

- 🤖 Open an issue or a discussion before submitting a Pull Request. We do not accept Pull Request that are not supported by a related issue or discussion. 

- 🖥️ Make focused changes (e.g. Do not change a whole module at once, focus on reporting bugs and fixing already open issues )

- ⭐ Do not submit very large pull requests (>5k lines of code changed) unless it's necessary

- 🔨 Create a new branch for your changes (we do not accept PR that are not supported by a dedicated working branch)

- 🫂 Respect the work of others. You can question anyone's work, but do it respectfully by suggesting constructive improvements. Anyone who violates this rule will be removed from the team and will never again be allowed to submit Pull Requests.
