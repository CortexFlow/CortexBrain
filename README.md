# ‚ÑπÔ∏è What is CortexBrain?
**CortexBrain** is an ambitious open-source project aimed at creating an intelligent, lightweight, and efficient architecture to connect cloud and edge devices seamlessly. 
By leveraging the power of eBPF, CortexBrain can successfully manage **networking** and **observability** in a distributed cluster, limiting resource waste and improving overall performance. 

The linux in-kernel verifier (BPF Verifier) ensures that all the programs are safe to run and a JIT compiler converts the bytecode to CPU architecture specific for native execution efficiency. CortexBrain can observe and trace network events such as **ingress** (incoming) and **egress** (outgoing) connections, apply policies, and distribute traffic among different backends directly at **kernel level** by attaching the programs in different hooks such as TC (traffic control) and XDP hooks. All the intercepted events are successfully notified in the user space thanks to BPF maps. 

Comprehensive information about CortexBrain‚Äôs core architecture, installation, and practical applications is available in the [Official Documentation](https://docs.cortexflow.org/) and on the [CortexFlow blog](https://blog.cortexflow.org/).

# **üßëüèª‚Äçüî¨ Current Development Focus**  

Our current development efforts are dedicated to the following key improvements:  

- üîß **System Architecture:** Optimizing the actual [architecture](https://www.cortexflow.org/doc/#architecture) by eliminating sidecar proxies while maintaining scalability
- üåê **Kernel-Level Observability with eBPF:** Enhancing system observability by leveraging eBPF to collect logs,metrics at the kernel level
- üìä **Expanded Metrics:** Extending the current [metrics](https://www.cortexflow.org/doc/#detected-metrics) landscape to provide deeper understanding  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Integrating a Command Line Interface:** We're actually working on a CLI to let users interact with the cluster without any stress or frustation. You can track the progress of the CLI tool by referring to the [[CLI Milestone]](https://github.com/CortexFlow/CortexBrain/milestone/3)
- üì° **Cloud-Edge Multi-Cluster Integration:** Enabling orchestration between cloud environments and edge devices
