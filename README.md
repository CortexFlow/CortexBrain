## What is CortexBrain?

CortexBrain is a robust simulation framework developed by CortexFlow, designed to simplify the simulation of IoT devices. Our goal is to model various IoT sensor properties, including smart lights, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and temperature sensors. With CortexBrain, you can simulate IoT sensors, place them on a geolocalized map, monitor key metrics, and simulate specific scenarios.

## Features

CortexBrain provides a range of powerful features, including:

- **IoT Sensor Simulation**: Simulate a variety of IoT sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and light sensors.
- **Geolocalized Map**: Position simulated sensors on a geolocalized map.
- **Scenario Simulation**: Create and test various scenarios with simulated sensors.

Explore all the features in the [documentation](doc.md).
