# üßë‚ÄçüíªWhat is CortexBrain?
**CortexBrain** is an ambitious open source project aimed at creating an intelligent, lightweight, and efficient architecture to seamlessly connect cloud and edge devices.  

# ‚öõÔ∏è **Current Development Focus**  

Our current development efforts are dedicated to the following key improvements:  

- üîß **System Architecture:** Optimizing the actual [architecture](https://www.cortexflow.org/doc/#architecture) by eliminating sidecar proxies while maintaining scalability
- üåê **Kernel-Level Observability with eBPF:** Enhancing system observability by leveraging eBPF to collect logs,metrics at the kernel level
- üìä **Expanded Metrics:** Extending the current [metrics](https://www.cortexflow.org/doc/#detected-metrics) landscape to provide deeper understanding  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Integrating a Command Line Interface:** We're actually working on a CLI to let users interact with the cluster without any stress or frustation. You can track the progress of the CLI tool by referring to the [Milestone]
- üì° **Cloud-Edge Multi-Cluster Integration:** Enabling orchestration between cloud environments and edge devices
