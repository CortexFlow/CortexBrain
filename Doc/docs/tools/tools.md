CortexFlow incorporates a multitude of tools to help developers and users, giving them tools to test and use CortexBrain to the fullest. Thanks to these tools, CortexFlow makes the development and use of CortexBrain possible even for intermediate users.

## Testing Scripts

Being in the midst of development, the use of testing scripts to test the operation of the architecture is essential. Any developer who decides to participate in the development of CortexBrain can enjoy a different range of testing to test various features such as installation, uninstallation, connection, and vital functionality of the proxy. You can find the tests in this folder [Testing Scripts](https://github.com/CortexFlow/CortexBrain/tree/main/Scripts)

## CortexFlow Command Line Interface (CLI)
CortexFlow CLI is a command line interface that allows users to interact with CortexBrain from the terminal and will start the development phase in April 2025. It will be designed to be a conduit between the user and the cluster by enabling the basic operations of installing and uninstalling, viewing metrics, and enabling the dashboard and all future CortexBrain components. You can monitor the development status of the tool through the branch [feature/cli](https://github.com/CortexFlow/CortexBrain/tree/feature/cli) .
