## An introduction to service mesh
A service mesh is a specialized infrastructure layer embedded within a software application that manages communication between services. It handles critical functions such as traffic routing, security, observability, and resiliency, while shielding individual services from these complexities.
In modern applications, functionality is often divided into a network of specialized services, each performing a specific task. To fulfill its role, a service may need to request data from multiple other services. However, issues arise when certain services, like the retailer’s inventory database, become overwhelmed with requests. This is where a service mesh proves invaluable—it orchestrates and optimizes communication between services, ensuring all components work seamlessly together.
