Why is CoreDNS Important in Kubernetes?

- Simplifies Service Discovery
CoreDNS allows services and pods to communicate using human-readable names instead of IP addresses.

- Dynamic Updates
It updates DNS records automatically as Kubernetes resources (e.g., services and pods) are created or deleted.

- Customizability
Its plugin-based design makes it adaptable to various needs, from simple DNS resolution to advanced monitoring and load balancing.

- Integration with Modern Infrastructure
CoreDNS is lightweight and scales seamlessly with Kubernetes clusters, making it a crucial component for cloud-native applications.
